# etch_a_sketch
New Project Notes:
This is the etch a sketch project from The Odin Project. The goal is to create
a type of interactive etch a sketch made of a certain number of divs that
change color as the mouse hovers over them. There needs to be an option
to change the total number of rows and colums, a reset button, a optiong to
change to color or black and white. 

Right now, I have no idea how to have the amount of divs change. Im pretty
sure initially i can get the 16*16 starting area up fairly easily but
after that, no idea how to create x number of divs based on an input without
specifically coding functions for each number combination. Wish me luck!

*DAY ONE*
I was able to get the "reset" button to prompt for x number of divs and create that many so win there!
My problem now is that I still have no idea how to put them in an equal grid automatically. I know I need
to resize them and have them grow or shrink depending on the gamecontainer but I don't know how to make that 
equal an even amount of rows and colums. Apparently you can't put javascript in CSS together otherwise I could
make it read x number of rows and x number of colums based on the user input but that doesn't work. I might have to seek
some help and guidance on that piece. 

*DAY TWO*
I was able to get the DIVS to line up in a grid with equal size! Not 100% sure why it works though so I def need to dig in a little bit
more to really figure it out. My next challenge is figuring out how to clear the board of the current divs before creating the next set.
Right now, it just adds more. Im going to take a break from this for a bit and dive into free code camps html/css projects a bit more 
and get started on the javascript "certification" course they have. I'm hoping it will help me get more comfortable with the concepts.
