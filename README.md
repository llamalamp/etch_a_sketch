# etch_a_sketch
New Project Notes:
This is the etch a sketch project from The Odin Project. The goal is to create
a type of interactive etch a sketch made of a certain number of divs that
change color as the mouse hovers over them. There needs to be an option
to change the total number of rows and colums, a reset button, a optiong to
change to color or black and white. 

Right now, I have no idea how to have the amount of divs change. Im pretty
sure initially i can get the 16*16 starting area up fairly easily but
after that, no idea how to create x number of divs based on an input without
specifically coding functions for each number combination. Wish me luck!

*DAY ONE*
I was able to get the "reset" button to prompt for x number of divs and create that many so win there!
My problem now is that I still have no idea how to put them in an equal grid automatically. I know I need
to resize them and have them grow or shrink depending on the gamecontainer but I don't know how to make that 
equal an even amount of rows and colums. Apparently you can't put javascript in CSS together otherwise I could
make it read x number of rows and x number of colums based on the user input but that doesn't work. I might have to seek
some help and guidance on that piece.
